97t  David Duchovny / Puff Daddy &amp; Jimmy Page
</pre>

Thus, the twentieth episode of the 1997-1998 season was hosted by David
Duchovny, with musical guests Puff Daddy &amp; Jimmy Page.

<p>
Each of the episode's segments is allocated a single 80-column line.  The
first four columns identify the segment type; column 5 indicates whether
or not the segment is known to be included in the 60-minute version of the
episode; column 6 is blank; columns 7-79 are used to describe the segment.
</p><hr>
<pre>cold  Mulder (host) rebuff puts Janet Reno (WIF) in Krycek's (Nicholas Lea) arm
</pre>
This segment is the <b>cold</b> opening.  The parentheses are used to indicate
actors in the segment (an absence of parentheses implies that the actor was
more-or-less being him/herself).  Here, Mulder is played by David Duchovny
(throughout the Guide, the word <b>host</b> is reserved to identify the person
hosting the episode), Krycek is played by Nicholas Lea, and Janet Reno is
played by Will Ferrell (castmembers are identified by an all-uppercase
three-letter castcode; see the

<a href="https://www.prismnet.com/~serpas/SNL/timeline.html">
Castmember Timeline</a>

for a complete list).
<hr>
<pre>mono: host gets frustrated upon dropping a pick into his boyhood guitar
</pre>
The colon (:) indicates that this <b>mono</b>logue appears in the 60-minute
version of the episode.  Because <b>host</b> isn't surrounded by parentheses,
David Duchovny was more-or-less playing himself.  To be included in an
episode summary, something "special" has to happen during a monologue
(a routine delivered by a stand-up comic host, a bit in which someone besides
the host is present, etc.).
<hr>
<pre>skit: (host) instructs Craig &amp; Arianna at Paula Abdul [real] Cheerleading Camp
</pre>

The identifier <b>[real]</b> in the description of this <b>skit</b> marks a
special appearance by Paula Abdul (if neither <b>[real]</b> nor the word
<b>cameo</b> is present in a segment description, the actual real person
wasn't on the show).  Because the parenthetical actor marker is only
used for the first appearance of a recurring character, the actors playing
<b>Craig</b> &amp; <b>Arianna</b> aren't listed (those characters first appeared
in 95e).
<hr>
<pre>TOON: "A Hard One To Swallow" by RBS- The Ambiguously Gay Duo seeks origins
</pre>
This car<b>TOON</b> was directed by former castmember Rob Smigel (the TOON
is capitalized to show that the segment was taped or filmed ahead of time, not
performed live).
<hr>
<pre>show: Jeopardy!- Sean Connery (DAH), Minnie Driver (MOS), Jeff Goldblum (host)
</pre>
When space permits, the segment's title (<b>Jeopardy!</b>) leads its
description.  To qualify as a <b>show</b>, the segment must be specifically
tied to the medium of television.  Though this isn't the first instance of
Darrell Hammond playing Sean Connery, the parenthetical actor marker is
included (by my definition, portrayals of real people or fictional characters
from literature / cinema / television / theater generally do not count as
recurring characters).
<hr>
<pre>song: musical guest performs "Come With Me"
</pre>
This <b>song</b> is performed by Puff Daddy &amp; Jimmy Page (<b>musical guest</b>
is reserved, just like <b>host</b> is).
<hr>
<pre>news  Dominican Lou disregards Clinton &amp; complains about rival super Wilfredo
news  unshaven &amp; pantyhoseless Cinder Calhoun says "Unshackle My Legs"
</pre>
The volume of individual items from the <b>news</b> report rules out including
them all, so only things like guest editorials and lengthy bits performed by
news anchors are included as segments.
<hr>
<pre>skit: host is enraptured by Mango; cameos by John Goodman, Matt Lauer, Al Roker
</pre>
The presence of the word <b>cameos</b> indicates that John Goodman, Matt
Lauer, and Al Roker appeared as themselves.
<hr>
<pre>show  Oprah (TIM)- Goat Boy is reunited with his brother (host)
</pre>
The absence of a colon after <b>show</b> indicates that this segment isn't
included in the 60-minute version of the episode.
<hr>
<pre>COMM: Interbank will do much more than replace your stolen travellers' checks
</pre>
This <b>COMM</b>ercial parody was produced ahead of time, as indicated by
the all-uppercase segment type description.  Fake commercials sometimes get
rerun in subsequent episodes; the indicator <b>{rerun}</b> in a segment
description denotes a verbatim repeat of something aired previously.
<hr>
<pre>show: From The Earth To The Area Around The Earth- a ho-hum Shuttle mission
</pre>
Another <b>show</b> segment.
<hr>
<pre>FILM: Golords battle James Cameron &amp; his army of Leonardo DiCaprio clones
</pre>
Though not seen in this instance, descriptions of short <b>FILM</b>s
often contain the title and director.
<hr>
<pre>MISC: The Lost Deep Thoughts of Jack Handey- on the use of baby traps
</pre>
Segments that don't fit into any of the other nine categories are labelled
as <b>MISC</b>ellaneous.
